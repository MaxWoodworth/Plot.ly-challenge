# Problems along the way
I didnt think I would come across too many problems as this was a pretty main focus of my part to project 2. I did not make the mistake of not clearing data for the first time. However two main problems I struggled with at length were, I was trying to build the meta-data table out before the function had even closed. This was causing the my demoraphics box to come up blank and I could not figure out for the longest time what was causing it. More frustratingly I kept running into an error was telling me that optionChanged was not a function of my html page. This drove me mad for sometime and I attempted to do all sorts of research to solve this issue. Ultimately I realized that I had tried to inbed this function within my init function when it should have been working on its own after.
